# How to fold a classic paper airplane
## The Dart

Obtain a lovely, uncreased 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of scrap paper 
1. Fold the paper in half vertically (hotdog, not hamburger).
2. Unfold the paper and fold the top two corners to the center line. The paper should have a stereotypical "house" shape.
3. Fold the resulting obtuse angles to the center line.
4. Fold the plane in half toward you, previous folds on the inside.
5. Fold the wings down, lining up the top edges up with the bottom edge of the body. 

**Tip: Using a ruler or pencil to press down the edges will help yield smoother folds and a more pointy tip**

6. Add double stick tape to the inside of the body if you're feeling fancy or want durability. 
7. Give her a test fly!
